# about the datasets 
this folder includes four data files: 
- Kaggle files 
  - Billboard Hot 100 data (with songs, their positions on the chart, and the weeks/dates they charted) 
  - Spotify data (compositional attributes of songs that were on the Billboard Hot 100) 
- Our files
  - Spotify data, but with our calculated "success scores" appended to the dataframe
  - A file exactly like the one described above, but only including songs with "love" in the title
